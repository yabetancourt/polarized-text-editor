# Polarized Text Editor

This project implements an English text editor that illustrates the polarity of each word as it is typed using colors. 

The editor uses the SentiWordNet tool to calculate the polarity of each word. The polarity of a word p is calculated as follows:

polarity(p) = (positivity(p) - negativity(p)) / (positivity(p) + negativity(p))

Where positivity(p) and negativity(p) are the positivity and negativity values provided by SentiWordNet.

It is important to note that a word can be in several synsets (i.e., it can have several meanings) within SentiWordNet. Therefore, it can have different positivity and negativity values in each of them.
## Features

    Real-time polarity coloring of words as they are typed
    Support for multiple synsets per word

## Running the application

The project is a standard Maven project. To run it from the command line,
type `mvnw` (Windows), or `./mvnw` (Mac & Linux), then open
http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

You can also import the project to your IDE of choice as you would with any
Maven project. Read more on [how to import Vaadin projects to different IDEs](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/guide/step-by-step/importing) (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans, and VS Code).

## Deploying to Production

To create a production build, call `mvnw clean package -Pproduction` (Windows),
or `./mvnw clean package -Pproduction` (Mac & Linux).
This will build a JAR file with all the dependencies and front-end resources,
ready to be deployed. The file can be found in the `target` folder after the build completes.

Once the JAR file is built, you can run it using
`java -jar target/polarized-editor-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`

## Project structure

- `MainLayout.java` in `src/main/java` contains the navigation setup (i.e., the
  side/top bar and the main menu). This setup uses

- `views` package in `src/main/java` contains the server-side Java views of your application.
- `views` folder in `frontend/` contains the client-side JavaScript views of your application.
- `themes` folder in `frontend/` contains the custom CSS styles.
